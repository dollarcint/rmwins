# Synchronization runbook

## Upstream endpoints

- `GET /supply/getAllocatedSurveys`
- `GET /supply/getAllocatedSurveysPaged?limit=100&next={cursor}`
- `GET /supply/getQuotaForSurvey/{surveyId}`
- `GET /supply/getSurveyTargeting/{surveyId}`

All calls use `x-access-token` and a configurable timeout. Pagination stops when no next cursor is returned, a cursor repeats, or `INNOVATEMR_MAX_PAGES` is exceeded.

## Inventory lifecycle

1. Create a running `SyncRun`.
2. Fetch the full endpoint.
3. Walk every paged endpoint cursor.
4. Merge by `surveyId` and newest `modifiedDate`.
5. Upsert normalized rows in one database transaction.
6. Mark previously-live rows absent from a completely successful merged response as closed.
7. Finish the audit run.

If either inventory source fails, the sync fails before closure logic, so a partial upstream response cannot incorrectly close surveys.

## Detail lifecycle

The minute detail job selects live surveys where quota or targeting has never synchronized or is older than `source_modified_at`. It processes at most `INNOVATEMR_DETAIL_REFRESH_BATCH` rows. Quota and targeting are replaced independently. A 404 means that detail type has no data and is stored as an empty successful result, so a missing quota cannot block targeting questions.

The UI's Quota and Pre-screening actions apply the same stale test. When refresh fails but a prior cache exists, the cache is served. When no cache has ever existed, the API returns an error instead of presenting an empty result as authoritative.

## Operational checks

- `/api/v1/sync-runs/?status=failed` shows inventory failures.
- `vendors.expire_allocation_reservations` releases abandoned vendor starts. Its interval and reservation TTL are independently controlled by `VENDOR_RESERVATION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` and `VENDOR_RESERVATION_TTL_MINUTES`.

## Legacy redirect reconciliation

`surveys.reconcile_pending_attempts` runs every `INNOVATEMR_ATTEMPT_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (60 seconds by default). It checks a bounded round-robin batch of recent attempts that reached InnovateMR but have no callback. Configure batch size with `INNOVATEMR_ATTEMPT_RECONCILE_BATCH` and the retry window with `INNOVATEMR_ATTEMPT_RECONCILE_LOOKBACK_HOURS`.

This is a compatibility fallback for old client redirect URLs. Once account-level or survey-specific redirect URLs and postbacks point to this application, browser callbacks/server notifications should remain the primary source and polling may be disabled by removing its Celery Beat entry.
- `python manage.py sync_surveys` isolates Celery/Redis from upstream and database troubleshooting.
- Swagger provides a direct authenticated-network test surface at `/api/docs/`.
- Validate credentials, DNS, supplier account allocation, and upstream rate limits before increasing detail batch size.

## Recovery

No destructive reset is required. Restore connectivity and rerun the sync. Upsert and replacement operations are idempotent. Local internal IDs remain stable across repeated imports and survey updates.
